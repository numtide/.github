At Numtide, we share a common joy for building things.

We ask everybody that's contributing to our projects to look past our differences and identities.

Identities are a sensitive topic. To aviod conflicts imminent to all the world's chaos, we put identities aside while respecting them. We try to be forgiving and assume that any person is acting for the common well-being and with a good will.

What matters for us is having a good time together and getting things done.

We share a common joy for building things.

We ask everybody that's contributing to try and look past our differences and
identities. I know it's a sensible topic but in all the chaos out there, we
try to put that aside for a moment. Try to be forgiving and apply charitable
interpretations.

What matters is that we have a good time together, and get things done.

At Numtide, we share a common joy for building things.

We ask everybody that's contributing to our projects to share this spirit, and to put ego, identities and politics aside. There is already enough conflict out there. 

We encourage you to:
* Enrich the conversation with wider perspectives when arguing on technical differences
* Try to be forgiving and assume that that the other person is acting in good faith.

What matters to us is having a good time together and getting things done. We make the world a tiny bit better by building things that are useful to others.

Thanks for your interest in our projects, and especially for considering becoming a contributor.


We try to keep things simple and low friction, so we ask contributors to follow certain principles. Here are some high level hints that describe how we work.

a. Before tackling big issues, open an issue or discussion. It's always a shame when good work goes to waste because developers haven't agreed on the design in advance. A "big" issue is any issue that you wouldn't classify as obvious, or that has a potential for a wiggle room in terms of design. Issues that aren't considered big are typos, documentation and bug fixes.

b. Try to leave the code in a better state than you found it:
   * Add test coverage, at minimum for the new feature you added.
   * Keep the CI green, and if your work broke something, push follow-up PRs. 
   * Run `nix fmt` to format the repo.

c. You probably want to install [Nix](https://nixos.org) because we use it everywhere. :)

If you have any questions, ping us on Matrix or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/numtide).

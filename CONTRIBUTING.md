Thanks for your interest in our little project. And even looking to contribute
to it!

Generally we try to keep things simple and low friction. Here are some
high-level pointers that show you how we work:

a. Open an issue or discussion before tackling big items. It's always a shame
   when good work goes to waste because we didn't agree on the design. "Big"
   is a bit subjective. Anything that you wouldn't classify as obvious or that
   has some potentially wiggle room in the design. Not included are typos,
   documentation and bug fixes.

b. Try to leave the code in a better state than you left it. This includes
   things like adding test coverage, at minimum for the new feature you added.
   Keep the CI green, and push follow-up PRs if your work broke something. Run
   `nix fmt` to format the repo.

c. Oh, and you probably want to install [Nix](https://nixos.org) because we
   use it everywhere.

That's it. If you have any questions ping us on Matrix, Twitter, ...
